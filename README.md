# micro.css
micro.css (no capitalization) is a teeny-tiny CSS framework for blogs.

If you wished for a "CSS framework without classes, lightweight and dark mode-compliant", you've came to the right place

This framework is split into two parts:
* All your bells and whistles
* and forms!

Well, the reason for that is in static websites, you don't particularly want a form (if you DO like forms in static websites, that's cool and I respect your opinion)

It's WIP, but will come out soon
